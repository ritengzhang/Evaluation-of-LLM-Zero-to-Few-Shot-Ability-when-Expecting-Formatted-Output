In stage 1, the accuracy of gpt family LLMs is evaluated, using different combinations of a number of examples, input_template, and few-shot label categories (random label, true label revered label). Two types of results are recorded: correct ratio and accuracy. The correct ratio is the probability that the output is the correct answer given the output is in the expected answer distribution. Accuracy is the probability that the ouput is the correct answer. Thus, when the true label is 1, and the set of possible labels is {0,1} if the output is 2, then it only hurts accuracy but not the correct ratio. 

The dataset used is Multi NLI. The results of 156 groups of testing in saved in multi_nli_result csv and multi_nli_fewshot_result. The coding for the analysis of these data is in the multi nli result analysis notebook.
